# Cryptographic Algorithm Architecture

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture of the cryptographic system being developed. The system aims to implement a more secure and efficient encryption and decryption process, with a focus on post-quantum cryptography. The goal is to enhance the security of data transmission while optimizing performance for both time and memory usage.

## System Components

The system is divided into several key modules that work together to perform encryption and decryption operations. Each module is designed with a specific responsibility, ensuring that the overall system is modular, maintainable, and easily extendable.

### 1. Key Generation (Keygen)
- **Description**: This module is responsible for generating the public and private keys used in the encryption and decryption process. Key generation is a crucial part of any cryptographic system, and ensuring its security and randomness is a priority.
- **Algorithms**: The system uses post-quantum algorithms such as **NTRU**, **Kyber**, or **Lizard** for key generation, as they are resistant to quantum computing threats.
- **Input/Output**: 
  - **Input**: Random number generation source (e.g., a secure random number generator).
  - **Output**: Public and private keys (in PEM format).

### 2. Encryption (Encrypt)
- **Description**: The encryption module is responsible for securing data using the public key. It ensures that the data can only be decrypted by someone possessing the corresponding private key.
- **Algorithms**: The encryption process uses a hybrid model, combining a **post-quantum cryptographic algorithm** (e.g., **Kyber**) with traditional symmetric encryption (e.g., **AES**), to provide both security against quantum attacks and efficiency in performance.
- **Input/Output**:
  - **Input**: Plaintext data, public key (PEM format).
  - **Output**: Encrypted data (ciphertext).

### 3. Decryption (Decrypt)
- **Description**: The decryption module reverses the encryption process, using the private key to recover the original plaintext data.
- **Algorithms**: The decryption process involves the use of the corresponding private key to decrypt the ciphertext. For post-quantum algorithms, decryption is based on efficient mathematical techniques that allow fast recovery of the original data.
- **Input/Output**:
  - **Input**: Encrypted data (ciphertext), private key (PEM format).
  - **Output**: Decrypted plaintext data.

### 4. Performance Monitoring (Profiler)
- **Description**: This module tracks and analyzes the performance of encryption and decryption operations. It measures time taken and memory usage during these operations and provides insights into any performance bottlenecks.
- **Tools**: The profiler uses **Python’s time module** and **memory-profiler** to measure performance. It can also track CPU and memory usage via **psutil**.
- **Metrics**:
  - Execution time (seconds).
  - Memory usage (MB).
  - CPU and disk usage.

### 5. Utilities (Utils)
- **Description**: This module includes utility functions that support the key generation, encryption, and decryption processes.
  - **Random Number Generation**: Secure random number generators for key generation and encryption.
  - **File I/O**: Functions for reading and writing files in plaintext and ciphertext formats.
  - **Error Handling**: Functions to manage potential errors during cryptographic operations.

## Data Flow

The data flow within the system is as follows:

1. **Key Generation**:
   - The user generates a key pair (public and private keys) using the keygen module.
   - These keys are stored in PEM format and used for encryption and decryption.

2. **Encryption**:
   - The user provides plaintext data (e.g., a file or a string) and the encryption system uses the public key to encrypt the data.
   - The resulting ciphertext is stored and can be securely transmitted.

3. **Decryption**:
   - The recipient uses the corresponding private key to decrypt the ciphertext and retrieve the original plaintext data.

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - During the encryption and decryption processes, the profiler monitors time and memory usage, ensuring that the system is efficient.
   - The system provides performance reports for further optimization.

## Security Considerations

- **Post-Quantum Security**: The system uses post-quantum cryptographic algorithms such as **Kyber** and **NTRU**, which are designed to be secure against quantum computing threats.
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation and storage methods are used to ensure the safety of both public and private keys. The private key should never be shared and should be securely stored on the user’s system.
- **Side-channel Resistance**: The algorithms implemented are designed to minimize the risk of side-channel attacks, ensuring that the cryptographic operations are resistant to timing, power, and other physical attacks.

## Performance Optimization

- **Efficiency**: The hybrid encryption approach combines post-quantum cryptography with traditional symmetric encryption methods, ensuring strong security while maintaining performance.
- **Memory Usage**: The system is optimized to minimize memory usage, especially for large files or datasets, by using efficient cryptographic operations.
- **Execution Time**: Performance tests ensure that the encryption and decryption processes take a minimal amount of time, even for large amounts of data.

## Future Enhancements

- **Algorithm Improvements**: Future versions of the system may incorporate newer post-quantum algorithms as they are developed.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: The use of hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs or specialized cryptographic hardware) could further improve the performance of encryption and decryption operations.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Enhancing the system to be cross-platform compatible (e.g., for use on different operating systems or mobile devices) will help broaden its applicability.

This system architecture provides a modular and efficient approach to post-quantum encryption and decryption, ensuring both security and performance. By combining the strengths of post-quantum cryptography with traditional techniques, the system offers a high level of protection against current and future computational threats.
