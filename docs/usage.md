# Cryptographic Algorithm Usage Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to use the cryptographic algorithm system. It explains the necessary steps to generate keys, encrypt and decrypt data, and perform performance analysis. Please follow the instructions below for smooth usage of the system.

## Prerequisites

Before using the cryptographic algorithm system, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Python 3.x**: The system is built with Python 3.x. Ensure you have the correct version of Python installed.
2. **Required Libraries**: The system depends on several libraries. These include:
   - `cryptography`: For cryptographic operations.
   - `psutil`: For monitoring system performance (e.g., CPU and memory usage).
   - `memory-profiler`: For profiling memory consumption.
   - `pycryptodome`: For providing cryptographic algorithms.
   - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
   - `pytest`: For running tests.
   
   Install these libraries using the Python package manager (`pip`).

## Overview of the Project Structure

The cryptographic algorithm project is organized as follows:

- **main.py**: The main entry point to run the application. It integrates all functionalities like key generation, encryption, and decryption.
- **utils/**: Contains various helper modules:
  - `keygen.py`: Handles key generation (public and private keys).
  - `encrypt.py`: Manages the encryption of data.
  - `decrypt.py`: Handles the decryption process.
  - `profiler.py`: Used for analyzing the system's performance.
  - `test.py`: Includes unit tests and performance tests to validate the system.
- **architecture.md**: Explains the technical architecture and design decisions behind the cryptographic algorithms.
- **usage.md**: This file, providing instructions on how to use the system.
- **README.md**: A general overview and description of the project.

## Key Features

### 1. Key Generation

The system provides functionality to generate cryptographic keys. This process generates a public key and a private key. These keys are used for the encryption and decryption operations.

### 2. Encryption

The encryption feature allows you to encrypt text or files. The system uses the public key to encrypt data, ensuring that only someone with the corresponding private key can decrypt the data.

### 3. Decryption

The decryption process reverses the encryption operation, taking the encrypted data and the private key to restore the original plaintext data.

### 4. Performance Monitoring

The system includes built-in tools to monitor the performance of cryptographic operations. This includes tracking the execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage during encryption and decryption tasks.

### 5. Testing

The project includes a set of tests that allow you to validate the functionality of key components. These tests check the correctness of encryption/decryption processes, performance metrics, and overall system stability.

## Workflow

Here’s a typical workflow to use the system:

1. **Generate keys**: Start by generating a public and private key pair. This will be used for encryption and decryption operations.
2. **Encrypt data**: After generating the keys, use the public key to encrypt a file or string.
3. **Decrypt data**: Once the data is encrypted, use the private key to decrypt it and retrieve the original content.
4. **Monitor performance**: Optionally, you can monitor the performance of the encryption/decryption processes using the profiling tools available in the system.

## Configuration

The cryptographic system uses default settings for key generation and encryption algorithms. If you want to customize these settings (e.g., change the encryption algorithm), you can modify the relevant sections in the code, particularly in the `encrypt.py` and `keygen.py` modules.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues users may face:

- **Key Generation Failures**: If the key generation process fails, ensure that your system has enough entropy for random number generation. Try running the system on a more powerful machine or adjusting your random number generator settings.
- **Encryption/Decryption Errors**: If encryption or decryption doesn’t work, double-check that you are using the correct keys. Encryption requires the public key, and decryption requires the private key.
- **Performance Issues**: If performance is a concern, try using the performance profiling tools. They will give you insights into how much time and memory are consumed during cryptographic operations.

## Future Improvements

- **Algorithm Enhancements**: Future versions will include support for additional post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, providing stronger security guarantees against quantum computing threats.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Currently, the system works on most platforms, but ongoing improvements aim to make it more robust and compatible across all environments.
- **Graphical Interface**: A graphical user interface (GUI) may be developed in the future to make the system easier to use for non-technical users.

## Conclusion

This usage guide outlines how to use the cryptographic algorithm system effectively. Follow the steps to generate keys, encrypt and decrypt data, and monitor system performance.
